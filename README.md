# microcontroller-pcb
Repository for continous integration of the microcontroller PCB. This PCB will have the Pico mounted to it and provide it power.

# Team Members
Currently being worked on by Nick and Shravya.

# Continuous Integration Automation
This includes a GitHub Actions script to manage and create `.svg` files of KiCAD schematic and PCB files. The `.svg` files can be viewed and diffed to manage development of the board. This does not work well with multiple concurrent branches. Nick is currently maintaining the script.
